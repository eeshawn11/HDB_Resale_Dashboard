# [HDB Resale Price Dashboard](https://eeshawn-hdb-resale.streamlit.app/)

This dashboard is inspired by [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/), and is an ongoing project to document my learning and experimentation with using Streamlit and various plotting libraries to create an interactive dashboard. While this could perhaps be more easily resolved by using PowerBI or Tableau, I am taking the opportunity to explore various Python libraries and understand their documentation.

The project is rather close to heart since I've been looking out for a resale flat after getting married in mid-2022, so hopefully this dashboard can contribute to my purchase decision. :blush:

Data from the dashboard is retrieved from Singapore's [Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/), a free portal with access to publicly-available datasets from over 70 public agencies made available under the terms of the [Singapore Open Data License](https://data.gov.sg/open-data-licence). In particular, we dive into the HDB resale flat prices [dataset](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices), while town boundaries in the chloropeth map are retrieved from [Master Plan 2014 Planning Area Boundary](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/master-plan-2014-planning-area-boundary-no-sea).
